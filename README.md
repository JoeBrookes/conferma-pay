# conferma-pay

* Requires .NET5.0
* Third party library used: CSVHelper
* Settings for PointsPerGuess, PointsToWin and ScoreFilePath can be found in appsettings.json
* Should create "high-scores.csv" automatically to specified path
* Intended to use dependancy injection for ScoreRepository, but doesnt work out of the box for console applications

I believe all the features specified are in there and working. I decided not to make a UI as it would take me a while to make it look nice :)
